What is it?
===========
The pluggable django-popularity makes it very easy to track the amount of views for objects, and generate popularity listings based upon that.

Right now it has a measure for view counts, relative view counts, novelty and popularity. The latter is still to be tested. Soon to be expected: randomness and the ability to sort by a combination of novelty, view counts, randomness and view count.

Status
======
We are nearing production stage, let's call it a beta. ;)
Also, please note that as of now we have about zero documentation.

Requirements
============
Currently, this is only tested for MySQL. It might also work for PostgresSQL and Oracle though.

License
=======
The django-agenda app is released 
under the GPL version 3.
